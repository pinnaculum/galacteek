**galacteek** is a multi-platform Qt5-based browser/toolbox
for the IPFS_ peer-to-peer network.

Installation
============

Stable release
--------------

* **AppImage (Linux)**: `Galacteek-0.4.31-x86_64.AppImage <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/releases/download/v0.4.31/Galacteek-0.4.31-x86_64.AppImage>`_
* **DMG (MacOS)**: `Galacteek-0.4.31.dmg <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/releases/download/v0.4.31/Galacteek-0.4.31.dmg>`_

Beta
----

* **AppImage (Linux)**: `Galacteek-3d0fc48a-x86_64.AppImage <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/releases/download/pimp-my-dweb-6/Galacteek-3d0fc48a-x86_64.AppImage>`_
* **DMG (MacOS)**: `Galacteek-3d0fc48a.dmg <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/releases/download/pimp-my-dweb-6/Galacteek-3d0fc48a.dmg>`_

*On Linux*: Be sure to install all the **gstreamer** packages on your
system to be able to use the mediaplayer. Problem with the AppImage ?
`Check the wiki <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/wiki/AppImage#troubleshooting>`_
or `file an issue <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/issues/new?assignees=&labels=appimage&template=appimage-issue.md&title=Cannot+run+the+AppImage>`_

*On MacOS*: After opening/mounting the DMG image, hold Control and click on the
**galacteek** icon, and select **Open** and accept. You probably need to
allow the system to install applications *from anywhere* in the security
settings. `Create an issue <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/issues/new?assignees=&labels=dmg&template=dmg-issue.md&title=Cannot+run+the+DMG+image>`_ if you
have problems running the DMG image.

You'll need to have *git* installed to sync hashmarks repositories.
See the releases_ page for all releases.

Features
========

**galacteek** can either spawn an IPFS daemon and use it as transport, or
connect to an existing IPFS daemon. By default it will try to run a daemon. You
can change the IPFS connection settings by clicking on the settings icon in the
toolbar and restart the application afterwards. If using a custom daemon, you
should enable pubsub and p2p streams, or some features won't be available
(`Check this page <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/wiki/Setup-your-daemon>`_
for more information).

- Decentralized Identifiers (DID) support with IPID_
- Browser-to-browser DID authentication over libp2p streams
  (Verifiable Credentials with RSA-PSS)
- Browsing sessions with automatic pinning (pins every page you browse)
- Distributed chat with pubsub (chat channels syncronized with CRDT+DAG)
- File manager with drag-and-drop support and timeframes (per-day view
  of files in the MFS)
- Webcam to IPFS capture (image and videos)
- Run WASM binaries with wasmer_ (use *Open* on a WASM object from the
  clipboard manager)
- Search content with the ipfs-search_ search engine as well as with cyber_
- Use the IPFS filestore to avoid file duplication
- Atom feeds (subscribe to feeds on the dweb)
- ENS_ (Ethereum Name Service) resolving (access to ENS+IPFS websites)
- Basic built-in media player with IPFS-stored playlists
- Image viewer
- QR codes from images

Command-line usage
==================

Use the *-d* command-line switch to enable debugging output. Using *--profile* gives
you the ability to have separate application profiles (*main* is the default
profile). Use *--help* for all options.

You can run the IPFS daemon in *offline* mode, using **--offline**

Enable colorized log output with **--log-color**

*Development*: Use *--monitor* to enable event-loop monitoring with aiomonitor_
(install aiomonitor_ manually as it's not a dependency).
Then connect to the aiomonitor_ interface with **nc localhost 50101**

Keyboard shortcuts
==================

Please see the shortcuts_ page (or from the application, click on the
Information icon in the toolbar, which will open the documentation).

Development
===========

For instructions on how to build the application, look at the
BUILDING_ page.

Contributions
=============

Contributions that can help:

- Write DID services (a chat service using JSON-LD for example)
- Translations (french, spanish)

If you want to sponsor this project please use the
`Github Sponsors page <https://github.com/sponsors/pinnaculum>`_

Platforms supported
===================

- Linux (main target)
- MacOS
- FreeBSD (or any BSD OS, with manual build)

Because of the nature of the software's stack (asyncio/Quamash),
support for any other platform is unlikely.

Requirements
============

- python3 >= 3.7
- go-ipfs_ >= 0.5.0
- PyQt5 >= 5.13.2
- PyQtWebengine >= 5.13.2
- gstreamer (on Linux) for media player support
- git
- quamash_
- aiohttp_
- aioipfs_
