## [0.5.2] - 2021-08-04

This release brings support for the gemini protocol.

performance issues ocurring with go-ipfs *0.9.0*.

### Added

[release notes](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.9.1)
for more details)

## [0.5.1] - 2021-06-29

### Added
- 1st iteration of a semantic dweb engine
  - Support translation of IPFS objects (mainly DAGs) to RDF graphs
  - Support querying the RDF graphs via SparQL from QML dapps
  - P2P SparQL services and exchange of objects over IPFS-P2P tunnels
- Enable the use of the new experimental *AcceleratedDHTClient*
  go-ipfs setting (this activates an alternative, faster DHT client)
- Support for IPFS URL browsing from QML (QtWebEngine QML integration)
- i:/ URL scheme

### Changed
- Use go-ipfs version *0.9.0*
- Use fs-repo-migrations version *2.0.1*

### Fixed
- Bug fix: "link to QA toolbar action"

## [0.5.0] - 2021-03-12

This release introduces support for *remote pinning*.

All IPFS services (pubsub, p2p) are now part of the
application's services graph (the application is now designed
as a graph of services, you can view the graph in the *Settings*
workspace).

### Added
- Use *go-ipfs* version: *0.8.0*
- Use *PyQt* version: *5.15.2*
- Use *PyQtWebEngine* version: *5.15.2*
- Support for remote pinning services (yay!)
  - Configure your RPS from the settings (tested with *Pinata*)
  - From the PIN object buttons (blue pin) you can choose to
    pin with a remote service or to your IPFS node
  - Add a status icon for remote pinning (basic for now)
- Add a workspace action to view the application's services graph
  (you need graphviz installed for this to work)
- Add coroutines to load services dynamically from the
  *services* Python package

### Changed
- Support for mkdocs themes (bootswatch) for your dwebsites
  (*darkly* is the default)
- Easier to publish/unpublish websites, dynamic content .. on your DID
- Easier to create and publish a markdown website
- QA toolbar: modernize, should now support large number of items
- Use a dock instead of a status bar
- MFS: recursive collapse when double-clicking an already-expanded
  directory
- Pubsub services are now part of the services tree
- P2P services (like the DIDauth service) are now part of the
  services tree

### Fixed
- Fix mkdocs website creation on non-Linux platforms
- Focus bug in the markdown editor

## [0.4.42] - 2020-12-12

This is build 42 (the end of the cycle).

RIP Douglas Adams, and thanks for all the fun.

### Added
- BitMessage support
- Themes support. *moon3* is the default theme
- Hierarchical, per-module config system based on omegaconf

- Introduce APIs to dynamically start P2P services associated with
  a DID service
- Introduce protocol versioning by default for P2P services
  /p2p/Qm..../x/pizza/1.0.0
- Async logging handlers (logbook)
- *galacteek.ipfs.ipfsops.IPFSOperator*: add coroutines to dial P2P
  services from a full service address, e.g /p2p/Qm..../x/myservice

  - [mode](https://github.com/ask/mode) == 4.4.0
  - [omegaconf](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf) == 2.0.5

### Changed
- Combine async services (*GService*) with in-app JSON-LD PubSub messaging.
  This should become the official way of pushing events throughout the app.
- Use dynamic, configurable processing throttlers for all pubsub services
- *galacteek.ipfs.asyncipfsd.AsyncIPFSDaemon*: the daemon's configuration
  is now done in an atomic call (by externally calling *ipfs config replace*).
  This makes the boot process faster.

- UTF-8 rendering of blog posts

## [0.4.41] - 2020-12-04

    transfer completed downloads to IPFS and have them linked in
    your *downloads* MFS directory.

  - [magnet2torrent](https://github.com/JohnDoee/magnet2torrent) >= 1.1.1
