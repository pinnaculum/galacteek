Editing documents

Markdown
--------

Common Markdown is supported, with the following extensions:

- attrlist_: this adds a syntax to define attributes on the various
  HTML elements in markdown’s output.
- mdxunimoji_: Converts defined emoticon symbols to Unicode emojis

Linking IPFS files
------------------

When writing a blog post or editing a markdown file, you may
want to create a hyperlink to a file that is stored on the
IPFS network.

From the text editor or blog post writer, right-clicking shows
a submenu which allows you to create markdown links for the
files referenced in the clipboard manager. First copy to the
clipboard the object you want to link, then from the editor
right-click and link this file, or hit **Ctrl-v** to create
a link for the latest item in the clipboard stack.
