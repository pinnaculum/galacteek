Quick access
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this part of the toolbar you can drag and drop IPFS objects and apps
that you want to have quick access to. You can drag and drop hashmarks
from the hashmarks manager or things that have no hashmark associated.

If you want to remove an item from the quickaccess bar, right-click the
item and click *Remove*.
